18 chicken wings
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 teaspoon cayenne

Modo de preparo

1. Preheat the oven to 375. Wash, dry, and season the wings with the salt, garlic, pepper, cayenne, sugar, and paprika. Spray a cookie sheet with a generous spray of cooking spray.
Place the wings in a single layer on the cookie sheet, and place in the oven. Cook for 35-40 minutes, depending on the size of the wings, turning once.
2. When the wings are done baking, carefully dip them in the sauce, and place them back in the oven for another 5 minutes, or until the sauce is bubbling.
